# DataStructures_RO

ðŸ”® Explore my Java implementations of various data structures, including interfaces, algorithm complexities, and error handling. Enhance your understanding of data structures and their practical application in software development. 

  -- *Available resources for **beginner** programmers*.

## Description:

This repository contains Java implementations of different data structures, developed based on the data structures courses from the Postgraduate Training Program in Computer Science. The courses originally provided pseudocode implementations, which we have translated in Java and supplemented with additional information and problem-solving solutions.

## Course Highlights:
The courses cover a wide range of topics related to data structures, including exercises and problem-solving implementations, interfaces and conditional operations, dynamic vector-based collections, dictionaries, lists, sets, as well as specific topics like hash tables, and trees.

## 
Feel free to explore the repository, examine the implementations, and utilize the accompanying documentation to deepen your understanding of data structures and their application in software development.

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
